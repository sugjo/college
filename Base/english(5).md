5. The instructions of the program must be complete and in the appropriate sequence, or else the wrong answers will result.
6. The first technique is flowcharting. The second technique for planning program logic is called pseudocode.
7. A flowchart is a plan in the form of a graphic or pictorial representation that uses predefined symbols to illustrate the program logic.
8. A plastic or metal guide called a template is used to make drawing the symbols easier.
9. Pseudocode is an imitation of actual program instructions.
10. Pseudocode has three basic structures: sequence, decision, and looping logic.
